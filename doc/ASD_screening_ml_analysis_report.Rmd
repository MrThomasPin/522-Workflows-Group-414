# Summary

## Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that impairs social interpretation/communication ability, as well as the presence of repetitive behaviors. Current diagnostic procedures are lengthy and inefficient [@Fadi]. Affecting 1.5% of the population, with many more cases going undetected, an easy-to-implement, effective screening method is warranted. ASDTest, a mobile app, has been introduced to provide an accessible screening method that tells the user whether they should seek formal healthcare opinions, based on a 10 question survey [@pmid22265366]. The ability to recognize and diagnose ASD at an early age can allow the affected to access the healthcare resources and support they will need, in a timely manner. 

The Autism Spectrum Quotient-10<sup>3</sup> (AQ-10) consists of 10 questions intended to differentiate characteristics of autism in individuals. Each question has four possible answers: "Definitely Agree", "Slightly Agree, "Slightly Disagree", and "Definitely Disagree". For questions 1, 5, 7, and 10, a value of 1 is assigned for either a "slightly agree" or a "definitely agree" response. For questions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9, a value of 1 is assigned for either a "slightly disagree" or a "definitely. disagree" response. A cumulative score is calculated for each individual, which is then used to recommend a healthcare opinion. An individual who receives a total score of greater than 6 is recommended for a specialist diagnostic assessment.

Surveys are useful screening tools, but there is always a concern that they can often be answered in a subjective manner. Therefore, we sought to understand how effective are these surveys in predicting an autism diagnosis, and which survey questions are the most effective predictors. Additionally, are these survey questions more useful in our models, compared to an individual's background (age, gender, ethnicity)?

# Results & Discussion

# Limitations

- could not get access directly to AQ-10 surveys for children and adolescents. We made an assumption that they follow the same metric as the adult AQ-10.
- Implications of removing the ?/others rows.
